## Overview

RFVC (React Form Validation Components) is an open-source library that provides a collection of reusable React form components with built-in validation features. The goal of RFVC is to simplify the process of creating forms in React applications, offering developers pre-built components for common form patterns and validations.

## Features

- **Ready-to-Use Components:** Easily integrate form components into your React projects without the need to build forms from scratch.

- **Validation Support:** Each form component comes with built-in validation features, reducing the need for manual validation code.

- **Adaptable UI Libraries:** Initially built using Material UI, RFVC is designed to expand and incorporate form components from other popular UI libraries based on user demand.

- **Consistent Design:** Ensure a consistent and professional look and feel across your applications by using standardized form components.

## version

- **Node Version:** 20.10.0
